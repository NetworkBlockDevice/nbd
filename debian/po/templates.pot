"Since nbd-client 1:3.14-1, the file /etc/nbd-client is no longer used for "
"boot-time configuration; instead, a file /etc/nbdtab is used, with a "
"different format. The debconf configuration options have been removed, and "
"this file is therefore never automatically generated, except that this "
"upgrade would have generated a /etc/nbdtab file from your /etc/nbd-client if "
"AUTO_GEN had not been set to \"n\". As such, you'll need to either disable "
"the AUTO_GEN line in /etc/nbd-client and call `dpkg-reconfigure nbd-client' "
"to allow the configuration to be migrated, or write the nbdtab file yourself "
"manually."
