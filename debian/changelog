  * Be more careful about what we unmount. Closes: #534728.
  * Fix three-argument nbdroot= boot option parsing. Closes: #568221.
    Thanks, Vagrant Cascadian.
  * nbd-client initramfs script: Remove default fallback to eth0. This
    was necessary in the past when initramfs-utils' configure_networking
    function could only be called from /init, but it was a hack and a
    workaround and it broke expectations. And it was ugly. Since
    configure_networking can now in fact be called from elsewhere, why
    bother with setting broken defaults, anyway? Right. Closes: #567232.
    Thanks again, Vagrant Cascadian.
  * Support setting root-on-NBD through DHCP by abusing the ROOTPATH
    variable. Closes: #568222. This supersedes the previous (broken)
    support that used ROOTSERVER -- broken, because the latter only
    supported setting the server, not the port, and obviously that's not
    enough. Thanks yet again, Vagrant.
  * debian/control: declare conformance to policy 3.8.4 (no changes
    applicable to nbd)
  * Override init.d-script-missing-dependency-on-remote_fs lintian tag
    for nbd-client. This is a false positive; we set $PATH to a sane
    value so that any modifications would work, but we don't actually
    use anything from /usr ourselves, and no, we really don't want to
    depend on $remote_fs, since we might be providing something like
    that ourselves, depending on setup.

  * Make the manual install invocations install stuff to debian/tmp
    rather than debian/nbd-{client,server}, so that they don't break if
    we're not building nbd-client and therefore the debian/nbd-client
    doesn't exist. This should make the build work again on kfreebsd-*.

nbd (1:2.9.13-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * nbd-server.postinst: Pass --debconf-ok parameter to ucf, to make it
    stop yelling about not being able to use debconf (it was, and
    db_stop wasn't called. This presumably was a bug, but whatever).
  * Remove overrides for dh_gencontrol and dh_builddeb, since debhelper
    7.4 no longer needs -s arguments. Bump required version of debhelper
    in build-depends to 7.4.0
  * Some more clarification and fixes to nbd-client README.Debian
  * Remove stray 'file' with diff output
  * Updated translation: Vietnamese, by Clytie Siddall. Closes: #548027.
  * Fix message at failed umount. Closes: #539766.
  * Add lintian overrides for "missing-stop" on nbd-client.init.d. We
    really do not wish to stop for runlevel 1.

nbd (1:2.9.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * nbd-client initscript:
    - replace `expr $i + 1` by $(( $i + 1 )), since expr is in /usr/bin
      which may not yet be mounted when we run this initscript. Closes:
      #539873.
    - check whether a device is connected at startup, and ignore those
      that are. Since we don't use 'set -e', that makes us compliant
      with the 'must exit successfully and not start the daemon again'
      part of policy 3.8.1.
  * nbd-server.postinst: call adduser only if 'nbd' user does not yet
    exist. Closes: #540604.
  * Convert to debhelper 7's "dh" mode.
  * Replace ifeq() make constructs with debhelper's -s option in a
    couple of overrides. Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing out that the
    option already exists when I filed a wishlist bug asking for it...
    grin.
  * Add debian packaging to git repository, and publish on
    alioth.debian.org, aka git.debian.org.
  * Add Vcs-Git header to debian/control.
  * Policy 3.8.3 compliance

  * The "Black Finger DebConf" release.
  * Add avr32 to nbd-client-udeb, too. Oops. Closes: #533694, hopefully
    for good.
  * nbd-client.README.Debian: add a bit more clarification on how
    root-on-NBD is supposed to work.
  * nbd-client.init.d: parse /proc/cmdline rather than /proc/mounts
    (the same way as how nbd-client.initrd does it) to figure out what
    the NBD root device is, so that root-on-LVM-on-nbd or something
    equally batshit insane does not confuse the sendsigs.omit.d
    generating code.
  * nbd-client.init.d: add support for an OMITKILL variable that will
    allow to specify extra nbd devices that should receive the same
    protection as for the above.
  * nbd-client.config: fetch KILLALL value from /etc/nbd-client (if it
    exists) and use it to db_set nbd-client/killall
  * nbd-client.postinst: fix so that KILLALL is correctly written to
    /etc/nbd-client, even if the number of devices is zero.
  * The above four were inspired by conversations with Vagrant
    Cascadian, while he was working on LTSP support in Debian. Thanks!
  * Updated Swedish translation. Thanks, Martin Bagge; Closes: #534246.

nbd (1:2.9.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "spring cleaning" release.
  * New upstream release.
    - The meaning of the -swap option has been changed; rather than
      trying to use a kernel patch which hasn't been maintained since
      the Linux 2.1.something days, use mlockall() to make sure we don't
      get swapped out. Closes: #409530.
      - Steal patch from git HEAD to document this change in nbd-client(8).
    - Removed (corrupt) winnbd.zip. Closes: #473823.
  * The Debconf templates have been reviewed by the debian-l10n-english
    team; incorporate those changes. Closes: #528476, 430701, 530711.
  * Updated debconf translations, to reflect the above:
    - Dutch, by myself
    - Swedish, by Martin Bagge; Closes: #529859.
    - Czech, by Miroslav Kure; Closes: #530236.
    - French, by Christian Perrier and the French l10n team; Closes: #530332.
    - Portuguese, by "Traduz - Portuguese Translation Team"; Closes: #531303.
  * New debconf translations:
    - Russian, by Yuri Kozlov; Closes: #531203.
  * nbd-client: install nbd-client.modprobe using debhelper rather than
    using our own 'install' invocation. This takes care of giving it the
    proper name (re recent module-init-tools) and moving files from the
    old to the new location. Depend on debhelper (>= 7.2.2) to make sure
    it has the required functionality to handle this correctly.
  * nbd-client.init.d: remove '-k' option from modprobe. This was once
    useful in the 2.4 days, but module-init-tools modprobe has never
    needed that option, and now produces an error message when it's
    used. Closes: #531620.
  * (Conditionally, compliant with the new DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS' "nocheck"
    option) re-enable the test suite. It did /not/ give false positives,
    ever.  However, it did indeed break at some point...
  * Update to debhelper compat level 7. 
  * nbd-client.postinst: don't use full path to update-initramfs.
  * copyright: refer to common-licenses/GPL-2 rather than the versionless
    variant.
  * That leaves one TODO for Policy 3.8.1: initscripts must not error
    out when 'start' is called and the daemon is already running. This
    will require some work (it might be there already, but I'm not sure
    and would need to test extensively).

  * The "merry christmas" release.
  * nbd-client: Install /etc/modprobe.d/nbd, which specifies a
    'max_part' parameter, to support partitions in NBD.
  * nbd-client.initrd: Strip partition number off the nbdbasedev and
    nbdrootdev parameters, to support booting off a partition rather
    than a device, if that is wanted.
  * nbd-client.init.d: In case of root-on-nbd, save our PID to
    /lib/init/rw/sendsigs.omit.d, so that we don't lose our root
    filesystem prematurely on shutdown.
  * nbd-client.postinst: call update-initramfs -u, to make initramfs
    script be actually installed.
  * configure.ac: remove KLCC crap, so that compilation doesn't break if
    klcc was accidentally installed. Is applied upstream for 2.9.12, but
    that isn't ready yet. Also, re-run autoconf.
  * nbd-server.1: clarify '-l host list' to be '-l host list filename',
    which it really is. Closes: #507875.
  * debian/control: bump standards-version to 3.8.0 (nothing applicable
    to nbd); add ${misc:Depends} to depends line on both nbd-server and
    nbd-client, both silence lintian to some extent.
  * debian/nbd-client.README.Debian: update

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes applicable to nbd)
  * Add "make check" to debian/rules build target.
  * Add initrd support to nbd-client package, to allow for running root on

    caution!
    Note: this currently does not support complex cases yet, such as using
    LVM-on-NBD or something equally insane. Stay tuned.

nbd (1:2.8.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support armel
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.7.2, from 3.6.2. No changes applicable to
    nbd

nbd (1:2.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Contains build fix against nbd.h from linux
    2.6.18.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Oct 2006 19:53:56 +0200

nbd (1:2.8.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set a proper default value in processing the return value to the first
    nbd-client debconf question, both in nbd-client.config and
    nbd-client.postinst. Closes: #367437.
  * Perform the same change for nbd-server.
  * Set the template type of nbd-client/no-auto-config and nbd-server/autogen
    to "error" instead of "text" resp. "note". Closes: #388942, #388943.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jun 2006 10:26:30 +0200

nbd (1:2.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Fix bugs before they apper" release.
  * New upstream release. Contained a one-line change compared to 2.8.3,
    which was already in the Debian package; but, well, newer version
    numbers look good :-)
  * Use invoke-rc.d rather than directly running the initscript in
    nbd-client.postinst.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Apr 2006 09:04:15 +0200

nbd (1:2.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steal patch from CVS for nbd-server.c to make children exit when they
    finish serving, rather than having them loop over "Help, I can't accept()
    anymore!". Closes: #350357.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 11:17:25 +0100

nbd (1:2.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; this one includes the fix for CVE-2005-3534 (and
    some more stability improvements).
  * Removed (outdated) local nbd.h, in favour of /usr/include/linux/nbd.h
    (which was being used anyway).

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Dec 2005 22:32:04 +0100

nbd (1:2.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes command line parsing; Closes: #338346.
  * Updated debhelper compatibility level to 4.

nbd (1:2.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Seriously reduces the CLIENT struct in size. Not only is this a good idea
    for 1023 int's that are hardly ever used, it also fixes an internal
    compiler error on s390. There.
  * Add armeb to debian/control. Closes: #335683.
  * Remove debian/nbd-server.1, debian/nbd-client.8,
    debian/nbd-server.manpages, and debian/nbd-client.manpages. They're old
    cruft that should have been dead for _ages_. Whoops.

nbd (1:2.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

nbd (1:2.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Includes fixes to nbd-client manpage; Closes:
    #317322.
  * Grammar and spelling fixes to both templates files (with .po files
    unfuzzied, as these are errors in the English version rather than
    changes); Closes: #315707.
  * Updated FSF address in debian/copyright.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Sep 2005 16:39:35 +0200

nbd (1:2.7.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix debian/rules to populate debian/nbd-client if DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM is
    "linux-gnu" in addition to when it is "linux". Closes: #321280. I hate it
    when interfaces change (note to self: no late-night uploads anymore).
  * While we're at it, make better use of debhelper. debian/nbd-client.dirs
    doesn't need to contain /bin; and dh_movefiles has been deprecated ages
    ago.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Aug 2005 20:52:02 +0200

nbd (1:2.7.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add alternate dependency on the virtual package debconf-2.0
  * Add ppc64 to the list of build architectures for nbd-client;

  * Add Vietnamese translation. Thanks, Clytie Siddall; Closes: #315705.
  * Add Czech translation. Thanks, Miroslav Kure; Closes: #318912.
  * Standards-Version bump to 3.6.2. No changes applicable to nbd.

nbd (1:2.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    a tad bit more reliable (thanks, Roy!)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat,  7 May 2005 11:37:20 +0200

nbd (1:2.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-add nbd.h to the source package, so that it will (again) build on 
    non-linux ports
  * As a precaution, modified the build target to barf out if it 
    disappears again.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Apr 2005 00:27:27 +0200

nbd (1:2.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Ensure we build as a non-native package again. Whoops.
  * Remove docbook-to-man from build-depends, and don't remove the manpages in
    the clean target. The upstream build system now supports this, and this
    will reduce the load on buildd hosts (as if it'd matter for this little
    package).

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Dec 2004 15:41:58 +0100

nbd (1:2.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the "docs" target from debian/rules. Docs are being generated from
    the upstream makefile since ages, so we don't need to do it a second time.
  * add --disable-dependency-tracking to configure call; that's only
    interesting if you would change stuff between doing the configure and the
    make, which we won't do, so don't waste time doing so. As if it'd
    matter...
  * nbd-server:
    - Bail out if the path provided to nbd-server isn't fully qualified. This
      won't work anyway (because we do daemon(), which changes the working
      directory to be /), and we don't want to confuse people.
      Closes: #274697.

nbd (1:2.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix debian/copyright file to point to the sourceforge.net pages, and
    to reflect the fact that I'm doing upstream maintenance these days as
    well.
  * Invoke "db_stop" at the right place in nbd-client.postinst, to make
    sure upgrades don't hang.

nbd (1:2.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix nbd-client initscript to use /sbin/nbd-client instead of
    /bin/nbd-client. Closes: #254713.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jun 2004 22:32:03 +0200

nbd (1:2.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Fixes multiple file snprintf, so that the "normal" use of NBD works
    again. Nbd-client will still hang when the server can't find a to be
    exported file (since the server doesn't close the socket, as it
    should), but that bug is a wee bit nastier, and this fix should get
    into stable.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Jun 2004 12:19:24 +0200

nbd (1:2.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add amd64 to debian/control. Closes: #251777.
  * This release was never uploaded by itself

nbd (1:2.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up LFS fuckup. Closes: #250450

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 31 May 2004 10:36:35 +0200

nbd (1:2.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - uses automake instead of home-grown Makefile.in; fix debian/rules to
      accomodate.
    - nbd-client moved to sbin, where it belongs; make sure we catch that.
  * Drop CFLAGS usage, use the --enable-* parameters instead.
  * Added catalan debconf translations. Thanks, Aleix Badia i Bosch;
    closes: #248727.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1; no changes applicable to nbd.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 17 May 2004 23:40:42 +0200

nbd (1:2.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix and document -m option (Closes: #246544, #264537)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 12 May 2004 08:29:17 +0200

nbd (1:2.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "There's more in this world than GNU/Linux" release.
  * For all you FreeBSD/NetBSD/Hurd-using people pleasure, made sure the
    package builds on non-Linux kernels, too. That's a two-line change to
    debian/rules, and is so silly that it should perhaps actually be handled
    in debhelper, but oh well.
    Tested this on Debian GNU/KFreeBSD, and yes, it works. Have fun!

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 2004 20:42:40 +0100

nbd (1:2.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * nbd-server.postinst: create a temporary file outside of the loop that
    writes to it. sigh.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jan 2004 14:22:20 +0100

nbd (1:2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New "upstream" release. Not much more than some code cleanup, really,
    but I'd just like to avoid "new upstream!" bugs before they happen.
  * nbd.h usage logic reversed: use the local one first; if that doesn't
    work, fall back to <linux/nbd.h>.
  * Include a (fixed) nbd.h. The kernel header will probably be fixed in
    2.6.1; as this is only a two-line fix (one for #ifdef and one for
    #endif), we won't wait for that. Closes: #223194. That's an RC bug,
    so raising the urgency a little.
  * This happens to fix a long-outstanding issue with nbd that I never
    had the will to fix: it now should compile nbd-server cleanly on
    non-linux systems, too. Reflected that in nbd-server's Architecture:
    line in debian/control

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Dec 2003 21:44:08 +0100

nbd (1:2.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
  * Bugfix: reset child_arraysize to zero when forking. When filed as a
    debian bug, the right severity would be 'critical' (not doing the
    child_arraysize reset can result in nbd-server sending SIGTERM to
    _all_ processes on the system), so urgency=high.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Sep 2003 20:33:55 +0200

nbd (1:2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run db_stop in postinst, to make sure dpkg doesn't wait for nothing.
  * Fixed a syntax error in nbd-server.1.sgml. Overlooked that.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Sep 2003 18:53:42 +0200

nbd (1:2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Brazilian Portuguese debconf translation. Thanks, Andre Luis
    Lopez; Closes: #208033.
  * Added '-l' option to nbd-server, to allow choosing a different name
    for the .allow file at run time. Should fix the thing I broke with the
    last upload, and adds the possibility to specify this file in the
    initscript.
  * fclose() the pid file after writing to it, so that start-stop-daemon
    does not find an empty file.
  * Some cosmetic change to nbd-server's initscript.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Sep 2003 18:49:42 +0200

nbd (1:2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Keep track of our child PID's, and relay a SIGTERM to them if we
      receive one
    - Use daemon() before we do anything.
    - Write our pid to /var/run/nbd-server.<port>.pid
    This allows me to use start-stop-daemon, instead of having to do all
    kinds of weird stuff in sh. And it also makes the postinst behave in
    that it no longer hangs, waiting for something to happen which never
    will. Woohoo!
    It breaks one thing, though: nbd-server used to look in the 'current
    directory' at the time it was started to find the 'nbd_server.allow'
    file, a hosts.allow-style file containing machines that are allowed to
    log on. Since the daemon() call requires to change the current
    directory to the root-directory, it is now looked for at that
    place. Will be fixed ASAP, but I wanted to get this out first.
  * Actually changed to using start-stop-daemon.
  * Updated nl.po. Closes: #204574.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 2003 10:24:49 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't forget to write unchanged configurations to the options file;
    also, make a backup of the configuration if we overwrite it. Closes:
    #203352.
  * Make sure NBD_SERVER_OPTS are being preserved.
  * Make a backup of /etc/nbd-client, too.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Aug 2003 20:13:33 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed README.Debian; it was outdated, and no longer useful.
  * Made sure the config script can handle being ran twice during the same
    installation run. Closes: #198062.
  * Made the templates in nbd-server and nbd-client about AUTO_GEN being
    set more consistent. Closes: #198929.
  * Added French debconf translation. Thanks, Christian Perrier;
    Closes: #200363

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 21:43:25 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revamped debconf stuff. It's now possible to configure multiple
    devices at installation time, while configuration changes should be
    preserved even if AUTO_GEN isn't set. Yay!
    Note that this is a short changelog for a lot of work; I mostly
    rewrote two .postinsts, redid two .configs from scratch, and had to
    rethink some things. I hope I caught all bugs :-)
  * /etc/nbd-client is now no longer a conffile. Since it's modified by
    postinst, it never should've been one anyway.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 20 May 2003 23:41:03 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed assignment error from macro OFFT_MAX. This resulted in a
    warning on all architectures, and reduced the usefullness of
    nbd-server to nothing on 64bit architectures. It also
    Closes: #187435, #188079. libc guys: sorry for the noise -- and thanks
    for pointing me at that little detail which I overlooked, and which
    proved to be the key (nbd-server::size_autodetect).
  * prepended the 'nbd-server' call with nohup, to make upgrades work
    again.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Apr 2003 03:31:18 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed a little spelling error from one of the Debconf
    descriptions. Closes: #186947.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Mar 2003 20:22:19 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed starting of nbd-server so that it properly detaches from a
    terminal. Closes: #179889
  * Converted to po-debconf
  * Bumped Standards-version from 3.5.2 to 3.5.9 (no changes
    applicable to nbd)
  * Made sure debian/nbd-server/bin exists before trying to copy files
    there, if we're not using dh_movefiles. Closes: #186668.
  * Added debconf translations from ddtp.debian.org

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Mar 2003 15:45:20 +0200

nbd (1:2.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed syntax error in nbd-client's postinst.
  * Removed duplicate update-rc.d commands (debhelper is nice, if it
    actually works ;-)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Nov 2002 01:04:06 +0100

nbd (1:2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed code in kernel-version sanity check in initscript so that it
    actually works now.
  * Rearranged start target of initscript so that it now just calls a
    'connect' and an 'activate' target of itself.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Nov 2002 21:24:28 +0100

nbd (1:2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced call to write() by a call to send(), so that NBD (hopefully)
    doesn't hang anymore. For those interested: For NBD to have Large File
    Support, it is being compiled with the precompiler directive
    _LARGEFILE_SOURCE set, and with the precompiler directive
    _FILE_OFFSET_BITS set to 64. As a result, all file operation syscalls
    are being replaced by their 64 bit counterparts. That's not a good
    idea to do on a socket, I believe...
  * Removed a bug that sometimes left /etc/nbd-server empty after
    (re-)install.
  * Rewrote warning in description about accessing the block device
    simultaneously from different clients to better reflect the
    truth. Sorry, ddtp ;-)
  * Added a sanity check to nbd-client's initscript: if the version of the
    kernel is < 2.4, disconnecting the client is not available, so
    restart will fail horribly, which also impacts upgrades. To avoid this
    problem, restart is made non-functional on kernels < 2.4.
  * Added a (conditional, as in sysvinit's /etc/init.d/checkfs.sh)
    spinner-option to the fsck in nbd-client's initscript.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Nov 2002 23:45:00 +0100

nbd (1:2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This version brings you:
    - Real Large File Support, coding by yours truly. This probably
      Closes: #161292. Please reopen the bugreport if not.
    - Auto-switching to read-only mode when serving a file from a
      read-only medium. This is useful for floppies, CD-ROMs or other host
      filesystems that can't be written on.
    - Updated manpage for nbd-server, documenting the new '-a' option.
  * Modified nbd-server's initscript to wait a second between sending
    SIGTERM and SIGKILL when stopping.
  * Added -DISSERVER to CFLAGS, which will cause debugging messages to
    go to syslog instead of stderr.

nbd (1:2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Reap zombies as they appear. Closes: #160374
    - Make error message that appears at the client's side when the
      server can't open the exported file a bit more helpful.
      Closes: #127098

nbd (1:2.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

nbd (1:2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. closes: #148092. Note that this was not a year
    out-of-date as the bugreport claims; the previous Debian version was
    pulled out of CVS at March 20th, 2002, at which time the new upstream
    release was (at least) not yet in CVS.
  * fixed nbd-server.postinst to 're'write /etc/nbd-server, even if it
    does not exist yet. Grmbl. Closes: #148090.
  * Modified manpages: fixed EXAMPLES, and a few other minor changes

nbd (1:1.2cvs20020320-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Cleaning up the mess" release
  * Added a "connect" target to nbd-client's /etc/init.d script. Use this
    to reconnect clients that have lost the connection to the server but
    still have an nbd blockdevice in use. No data will be lost that way,
    which is not the case if you use a "restart".
  * Since upstream is not really doing any "releases" anymore (there's one
    stable CVS branch which is only updated as bugs are fixed), use
    "1.2-cvsYYYYMMDD" as upstream version now.
  * New CVS change: using setsockopt() in nbd-server so that a stopped
    server doesn't need to wait for a timeout before it can be restarted.
  * This time really removed the duplicate output to /etc/nbd-server. I
    tried to be smart, but not anymore ;-)
  * Since my manpages are accepted by upstream and in upstream CVS,
    removed them from the debian/ directory.

nbd (1:1.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made /dev-entry debconf-question a bit clearer (Closes: #127094)
  * Explained the use of the nbd_server.allow file in nbd-server's manpage
    (partially closes #127098)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jan 2002 23:49:43 +0100

nbd (1:1.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected spelling errors in descriptions (Closes: #125167, #125168)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Dec 2001 00:40:13 +0100

nbd (1:1.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an invocation of fsck to nbd-client's initscript. This should've
    been done in 1:1.2-1. Really.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Oct 2001 12:37:06 +0100

nbd (1:1.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Branden Robinson for nbd-server's initscript
    (partially closes #117045)
  * Modified nbd-server's postinst so that it doesn't write it's
    information twice to /etc/nbd-server (Closes: #117045).
  * Changed shebang-line of all scripts that source the configfile to use
    /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh. I thought it would be no problem if I
    don't actually use the variable, but even the variable name isn't
    POSIXly correct (Closes: #117303).
  * Changed priority of AUTO_GEN debconf to low. You don't want to see
    this during an installation, only during a reconfigure. Also, added a
    similar note to nbd-server, since it now supports this variable too.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Oct 2001 11:20:07 +0100

nbd (1:1.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed nbd-server's debconf configuration so that it actually works
    now. Always interesting, huh?
  * Added some upstream-suggested changes to nbd-server.c so that it
    should build on mips and mipsel too, now (Closes: #115110). Added mips
    and mipsel to Architecture line (I created that line with the output
    of madison nearby. But since it never built on mips before... well...)
  * Fixed some minor bugs in initscripts and postinsts.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Oct 2001 16:47:05 +0200

nbd (1:1.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed a syntaxis fault from nbd-server's postrm. Dunno why I
    didn't find this earlier...

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Oct 2001 00:08:17 +0200

nbd (1:1.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since my TODO list is kinda complete now (Yeehaw!), remove the
    reference to it from debian/control.
  * Aestetical changes to initscript of nbd-server
  * Uncommented things in nbd-client's initscript. It didn't work before,
    but apparently it does now. I have no idea what was wrong; probably a
    bug in another package (most likely, bash) that has been solved now
    (it never looked wrong to me anyway). Please file a bug if I was
    wrong... ;-)
  * Now really modified nbd-client.postinst to do what it was supposed to
    do in 1:1.2-6. Actually, in -6 I modified nbd-server.postinst, but
    didn't touch nbd-client.postinst. I thus now modified
    nbd-client.postinst to reflect changes made to nbd-server.postinst in
    -6. Should've done that in the previous release, probably.
  * Removed hurd-i386 from architecture, since it doesn't build there
    after all.
    There has been some effort to port NBD to the Hurd, though, so I'll
    change the "Architecture:" line at some point in the future, when
    everything compiles cleanly. Not now, though.
  * Added pt_BR translations of both debconf templates. Thanks go to Andre
    Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br> (Closes: #115617, 115621)

nbd (1:1.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added german translation of debian/nbd-server.templates. Thanks go to
    Sebastian Feltel <sebastian@feltel.de> (Closes: #113486).
  * Minor changes to nbd-server manpage.
  * Made debian/nbd-server.postinst a bit more portable so that it creates
    good output, even if /bin/sh does not point to /bin/bash. Also, added
    support for extra options to /etc/nbd-server; add an array called
    NBD_SERVER_OPTS with the options you'd like (Closes: #113726). Since
    these options are probably quite rarely needed, I didn't change the
    debconf-configuration.
  * Slightly modified nbd-client.postinst so that grep dumps
    "NBD_DEVICE[0]" to /dev/null instead of stdout (Ah! So it was grep!
    ;-)
  * Made sure the "purge" target of nbd-server's postrm removes
    /etc/nbd-server. Since /etc/nbd-server is created in postinst, it is
    not part of any package or file, let alone it being a
    conffile. Therefore, I have to remove it manually in the postrm.

nbd (1:1.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure /etc/nbd-server exists before trying to access it
    (Closes: #113143)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 11:38:51 -0400

nbd (1:1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debian/rules file a bit so that this package should build the
    nbd-server on non-linux ports (currently only The
    Hurd). Unfortunately, I have to sum up each and every linux-port to
    achieve this. Have a look at #112325 to find out why. Since nbd-client
    needs support from the kernel, and since this is a linux-only thing,
    it makes no sense compiling nbd-client on other kernels. Hence, I
    don't try.
  * Created manpages for both nbd-client and nbd-server (Closes: #112049)
  * Now created an initscript for nbd-server too. Works the same way as
    the nbd-client initscript.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Sep 2001 13:37:34 +0200

nbd (1:1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed bugs from postinst and /etc/init.d/nbd-client (closes:
    #112117)

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Sep 2001 02:16:40 +0200

nbd (1:1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debconf-configuration to install one nbd-client device. This
    should work for most installations.
  * Added information to /etc/nbd-client. See the file for details; it
    allows for multiple clients to be ran and killed at boot
    resp. shutdown.
  * Changed init.d-script for nbd-client (the previous changelog-entry
    fails to tell that the init.d-script is only for nbd-client too, BTW)
    to reflect new situation.

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Sep 2001 00:26:39 +0200

nbd (1:1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added init.d-script
  * Added Build-Depends on kernel-headers, since #include "nbd.h" has
    changed to #include <linux/nbd.h> in upstream sources

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Jun 2001 22:23:38 +0200

nbd (14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Did some cleanup of debian/rules

 -- Wouter Verhelst <wouter@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Jun 2001 00:51:36 +0200

nbd (14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (Closes: 96728)
