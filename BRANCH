What does this fix?  It includes the fixes
mailed to the nbd mailing list as the README suggests I do


Here is the mail

Hi,

I have a simple test case where nbd corrupts the date read back if
copyonwrite=true, and another one if sparse_cow=true.

I also have patches that I believe fix this.


For the first case, it's enough to read and write more than one
sequential block.  The second and subsequent blocks read will read into
the wrong offset of the buffer, and copy invalid data to the client.

I use a 4096 block size in this example, but I've used others.  I did
that to match the filesystem, but for the test I don't even need a
filesystem.

The test:

export OFFSET=0
export COUNT=3 # anything >= 1
dd if=/dev/urandom of=testdata bs=4096 count=$COUNT # random data
dd if=testdata of=/dev/nbd0 bs=4096 seek=$OFFSET count=$COUNT
dd if=/dev/nbd0 of=compdata bs=4096 skip=$OFFSET count=$COUNT
sum testdata compdata

The data will be different.

If the kernel does a partition check on /dev/nbd0 it will fail with
COUNT=1 as well.


For the second case, with sparse_cow=true, we need to repeat the test
with an offset > 0.  expwrite() calls write() instead of pwrite().

export OFFSET=100
export COUNT=3 # anything >= 1
dd if=/dev/urandom of=testdata bs=4096 count=$COUNT # random data
dd if=testdata of=/dev/nbd0 bs=4096 seek=$OFFSET count=$COUNT
dd if=/dev/nbd0 of=compdata bs=4096 skip=$OFFSET count=$COUNT
sum testdata compdata

The first time it's run, it will result in an Input/Output error.

The second time it's run, it will work.
