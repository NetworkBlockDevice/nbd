    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This file allows to configure the nbd-server.</para>

    <para>While
      <filename>$sysconfdir/nbd-server/config</filename> is the default
      configuration file, this can be varied with the <option>-C</option>
      option to <command>nbd-server</command>(1).
    </para>
    <para>
      The configuration file consists of section header lines, comment
      lines, and option lines.
    </para>
    <para>
      A section header is a unique name that
      is enclosed in square brackets ("[" and "]"). A section header
      denotes the beginning of a section; a section continues until
      the next section or the end of the file, whichever is first. The
      first section in the configuration file must be called
      <option>generic</option>, and is used for global options that
      apply to more than one export. This section must always be
      present, even if it holds no options. Every other section
      defines one export; the names of these sections are not
      important, except that you should take care to make sure that
      each section name is unique. The section name is used as the name
      for the export in case the client connects with a name rather than
      a port to specify an export, and must therefore be unique.
    </para>
    <para>
      A comment line is a line that starts with optional whitespace,
      followed by a pound sign ("#"), and continues until the end of
      the line. Comments may <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used on
      option lines or section header lines.
    </para>
    <para>
      An option line is a line that starts with an option name,
      followed by an equals sign ("="), followed by the option
      value. An option can be of type string, of type integer, or of
      type boolean. The value of a boolean option can be denoted with
      either true or false (so not yes, no, on, off, 1, or 0). All
      booleans default to false unless specified otherwise. No value
      may be quoted; always enter it directly. For a string option,
      leading whitespace is stripped (but trailing whitespace is not).

    <title>OPTIONS FOR SECTION [generic]</title>

    <!-- These are in alphabetical order, please keep it that way -->    
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>allowlist</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; boolean
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     Whether to allow the client to fetch a list of exports from
	     this server. If enabled, the client can run
	     <command>nbd-client -l</command> to get a list of exports
	     on this server.
	   </para>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>group</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The name of the group this server must run as. If this
	    parameter is not specified, then nbd-server will not
	    attempt to change its GID (so the GID it runs as will be
	    the primary group of the user who starts nbd-server). If
	    it is specified, then nbd-server will change its GID after
	    opening ports, but before accepting connections or opening
	    files.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>includedir</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The argument should be a directory containing files with
	    the '.conf' extension; these files will be parsed as if
	    they were part of the configuration file. Note that these
	    extra configuration files cannot contain a [generic]
	    section; any configuration that should go in the generic
	    section must be placed in the main configuration file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If this argument is not specified, then no directory will
	    be searched. If it is specified but the directory does not
	    exist, then nbd-server will exit with an appropriate error
	    message; if it is specified but the given directory is
	    empty, nbd-server will continue (unless no exports
	    whatsoever have been configured, in which case it will
	    exit with an appropriate error message)
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>listenaddr</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string
	  </para>
	  <para>If this option is set, it should contain the local IP
	  address on which we should listen to
	  <command>nbd-client</command>(8) connections. If it is not
	    set, <command>nbd-server</command> will listen to all
	  local IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. To limit to IPv6, specify the
	  address as "::". To limit to IPv4, specify as "0.0.0.0". It
	  is not possible to specify more than one IP address
	  here.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>oldstyle</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; boolean
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If this option is set to true, nbd-server will export all
	    exports on a separate port with the old (pre-2.9.17)
	    handshake protocol. In that case, the 'port' option for
	    individual exports is mandatory.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the option is set to false, the 'port' option for
	    individual exports is optional (and will be ignored if
	    specified). The server will only export devices on the
	    standard port.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For upgrades from pre-2.9.17 versions of nbd, it may be
	    appropriate to enable the oldstyle parameter until all
	    clients have been converted to using name-based exports.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that exports specified on the command line will
	    always use the old handshake protocol and will not allow
	    name-based exports.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Also note that even if this parameter is set to true, all
	    exports will also be made available using the new handshake
	    protocol; it is not possible to switch that off. The reason
	    for this is that the old style protocol will eventually be
	    deprecated, and this option is only available to allow for
	    smooth upgrades.
	  </para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>port</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The port on which to listen for new-style nbd-client
	    connections. If not specified, the IANA-assigned port of
	    10809 is used.
	  </para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>user</option></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
	    Optional; string.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The name of the user this server must run as. If this
	    parameter is not specified, then nbd-server will not
	    attempt to change its UID (so the UID it runs as will be
	    the user who starts nbd-server). If it is specified, then
	    nbd-server will change its UID after opening ports, but
	    before accepting connections or opening files.

    <title>OPTIONS FOR EXPORT SECTIONS</title>

    <!-- These are in alphabetical order, please keep it that way -->
    <variablelist>

	<term><option>authfile</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string; default
	    <filename>$sysconfdir/nbd-server/allow</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The name of the authorization file for this export. This
	    file should contain one line per IP-address, or per
	    network (which must be specified in CIDR-style
	    <option><replaceable>network</replaceable>/<replaceable>masklen</replaceable></option>)
	    and must not contain empty lines. If the file
	    does not exist, everyone is allowed to connect. If the
	    file exists but is empty, nobody is allowed to
	    connect. Otherwise, <command>nbd-server</command> will
	    only allow clients to connect whose IP-adres is listed in
	    this file.
	  </para>
	  <para>Corresponds to the <option>-l</option> option on the

      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>copyonwrite</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; boolean.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Whether this is a copy-on-write export. If it is, then any
	    writes to this export will not be written to the master
	    file, but to a separate file which will be removed upon
	    disconnect. The result of using this option is that
	    nbd-server will be somewhat slower, and that any writes will
	    be lost upon disconnect.
	  </para>
	  <para>Corresponds to the <option>-c</option> option on the
	    command line</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>exportname</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Required; string.</para>
	  <para>
	    The name of the file (or block device) that will be
	    exported. This must be a fully-qualified path and filename;
	    relative paths are not allowed. If used in conjunction with
	    the <option>temporary</option>, this specifies a template
	    for the temporary file concerned, and thus can be used
	    to control the directory it is created in. If the file
	    does not exist, but <option>filesize</option> is set, then
	    the file will be created.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that <command>nbd-server</command> will only try to
	    find and open the exported file when a client actually
	    connects; as a result, <command>nbd-server</command> must
	    be able to open and read this file
	    <emphasis>after</emphasis> changing to the user and group
	    that have been specified by use of the
	    <option>user</option> and <option>group</option> options;
	    also, <command>nbd-server</command> will only detect
	    errors in this option upon connection of a client.
	  </para>
	  <para>When specified on the command line, this should be the
	    second argument.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>filesize</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; integer; default autodetected.</para>
	  <para>
	    Disable autodetection of file or block device size, and
	    forcibly specify a size. Sizes must be specified in
	    bytes. If the <option>multifile</option> option is in
	    effect, this option specifies the size of the
	    <emphasis>entire</emphasis> export, not of individual
	    files. If the file is not present, a single file is
	    created of this size.
	  </para>
	  <para>When specified on the command line, this should be the
	    third argument.

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>flush</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; boolean.</para>
	  <para>When this option is enabled,
	    <command>nbd-server</command> will inform the client that it
	    supports and desires to be sent flush requests when the
	    elevator layer receives them. Receipt of a flush request
	    will cause an fdatasync() (or, if the sync option is set,
	    an fsync()) on the backend storage. This increases
	    reliability in the case of an unclean shutdown at
	    the expense of a degradation of performance. This option
	    will have no effect unless supported by the client.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>fua</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; boolean.</para>
	  <para>When this option is enabled,
	    <command>nbd-server</command> will inform the client that it
	    supports and desires to be sent fua (force unit access) commands
	    when the elevator layer receives them. Receipt of a force unit
	    access command will cause the specified command to be synced
	    to backend storage using sync_file_range() if supported, or
	    fdatasync() otherwise. This increases
	    reliability in the case of an unclean shutdown at
	    the expense of a degradation of performance. This option
	    will have no effect unless supported by the client.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>listenaddr</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Optional; string
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the 'oldstyle' global parameter is specified, works
	    similarly to the global listenaddr parameter, but for the
	    individual port of this particular export. If the 'oldstyle'
	    parameter is not set, this parameter is ignored.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>maxconnections</option></term>
	<listitem>

	  <para>
	    If specified, then it limits the number of opened connections for
	    this export.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>multifile</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; boolean.</para>
	  <para>
	    If this option is set to true, then
	    <command>nbd-server</command> will search for files of the
	    form
	    <replaceable>exportname</replaceable>.<replaceable>integer</replaceable>,
	    with <replaceable>exportname</replaceable> being the
	    filename that would otherwise have been used (after name
	    transformation for virtualization, if any, has been
	    performed) and <replaceable>integer</replaceable> an
	    integer number, starting with 0 and ending when no more
	    files can be found.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The size of the individual files will be autodetected,
	    <emphasis>even</emphasis> if the <option>filesize</option>
	    option has been specified.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Corresponds to the <option>-m</option> option on the

      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>port</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Required if 'oldstyle' global parameter is set; integer.</para>
	  <para>
	    The port on which this export is to be served using the
	    old-style handshake protocol.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This parameter only makes sense when the 'oldstyle'
	    parameter is set to true in the 'generic' section. If that
	    parameter is not set, but this parameter is found in an
	    export section, then nbd-server will issue a warning upon
	    startup but should otherwise continue to function correctly.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It is not possible to combine multiple exports on the same
	    port using the old style handshake. Please use the new style
	    handshake for that purpose.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When specified on the command line, this should be the

	<term><option>postrun</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; string</para>
	  <para>
	    If specified, then it is assumed to be a command
	    that will be ran when a client has
	    disconnected. This can be useful to clean up
	    whatever <option>prerun</option> has set up, to log
	    something, or similar.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the literal string '%s' is present in the
	    command, it will be replaced by the file name that
	    has just been closed.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In contrast to the <option>prerun</option> option,

	<term><option>prerun</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; string</para>
	  <para>
	    If specified, then this command will be ran after a
	    client has connected to the server (and has been
	    accepted), but before the server starts serving. If
	    the command contains the literal string '%s', then
	    this string will be replaced by the filename of the
	    file which nbd-server wants to export.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This is useful to create export files on the fly, or
	    to verify that a file can be used for export, to
	    write something to a log file, or similar.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the command runs with a non-zero exit status,
	    then nbd-server will assume the export will fail,
	    and refuse to serve it.

	  <para>
	    Use of this option in conjunction with

	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; boolean.</para>
	  <para>When this option is enabled,
	    <command>nbd-server</command> will inform the client that 
	    it would prefer it to send requests in elevator (i.e., optimized) order, perhaps
	    because it has a backing store and no local elevator. By
	    default, the client uses QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, which effectively
	    restricts the function of the elevator to block merges. By
	    specifying this flag on the server, the client will not use
	    QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, meaning the client elevator will perform
	    normal elevator ordering of I/O requests. Note that even when
	    the backing store is on rotating media, it is not normally
	    necessary to specify this flag, as the server's elevator
	    algorithm will be used. This flag is only required where
	    the server will not be using an elevator algorithm or where
	    the elevator algorithm is effectively neutered (e.g. with
	    the sync option set). This option will have no effect unless
	    supported by the client.

	  <para>
	    When this option is enabled, <command>nbd-server</command>
	    will use the Socket Direct Protocol (SDP) to serve the

	    special hardware (usually something like InfiniBand) and
	    support in the kernel.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Additionally, support for this option must be enabled at
	    compile time, using the <option>--enable-sdp</option> option

	    is found in a configuration file and
	    <command>nbd-server</command> does not have support for SDP,

	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; boolean.</para>
	  <para>
	    When this option is enabled, <command>nbd-server</command>
	    will use sparse files to implement the copy-on-write
	    option; such files take up less space then they appear to,
	    which allows <command>nbd-server</command> to handle the
	    file as if it was just as large as the block device it's
	    for.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If this option is disabled, <command>nbd-server</command>
	    will map every newly written block to the end of the
	    copy-on-write file, which means that
	    <command>nbd-server</command> will have to lseek(2) to the
	    right position after every 4096-byte block.
	  </para>

	  <para>When this option is enabled,

	    write to the backend storage. Calling fsync() increases
	    reliability in case of an unclean shutdown of nbd-server; but,
	    depending on the file system used on the nbd-server side, may
	    degrade performance. The use of this option isn't always
	    necessary; e.g., on ext3 filesystems, it is recommended that
	    it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> enabled, since it seriously
	    reduces performance on ext3 filesystems while not
	    importantly impacting reliability.

	    Create a temporary export with a name based on exportname

	<listitem>
	  <para>Optional; string</para>
	  <para>
	    If specified, then this pathname is used to generate a transaction
	    log. A transaction log is a binary file consisting of the requests
	    sent to and the replies received by the server, but excluding any
	    data (so, for a write command, it records the offset and length
	    of the write but not the data written). It is therefore relatively
	    safe to distribute to a third party. Note that the transaction log
	    does not include the negotiation sequence. Transaction logs are
	    mainly useful for debugging. The program
	    <emphasis>nbd-tester-client</emphasis> distributed with the source
	    to this program can reply a transaction log against a server and
	    perform a data integrity test. Note that the transaction log is
	    written to for every client opened. If it is necessary to maintain
	    separate transaction logs for each client, the
	    <emphasis>prerun</emphasis> script should rename the transaction log
	    (which will just have been opened in order to avoid transaction logs
	    overwriting eachother. This action should be race-free.

	  <para>
	    Defines the style of virtualization. Virtualization allows
	    one to create one export that will serve a different file
	    depending on the IP address that is connecting. When
	    virtualization is active, the
	    <replaceable>exportname</replaceable> parameter needs to
	    contain the string '%s'; this will then be replaced by the
	    IP address of the client connecting, in accordance with the
	    option selected here. The result of this transformation is
	    then used as the filename to be opened.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    There are four types of virtualization that
	    <command>nbd-server</command> supports:

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term><option>none</option></term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  No virtualization. Will attempt to open the filename
		  as it was written, even if it contains '%s' in the
		  name.

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term><option>ipliteral</option></term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  The %s is replaced by the IP address of the connecting
		  host is used as-is.  For IPv4, this is done in
		  dotted-quad notation; for IPv6, in hexadecimal form
		  with leading zeros omitted.
		</para>
		<para>
		  As an example, if a client connects from 192.168.1.100
		  and <option>exportname</option> is specified as
		  <filename>/export/%s</filename>, then nbd-server will
		  attempt to serve
		  <filename>/export/192.168.1.100</filename>. For IPv6,
		  with a client connecting from 2001:6f8:32f::39, the
		  filename would be
		  <filename>/export/2001:6f8:32f:0:0:0:0:39</filename>

	      <term><option>iphash</option></term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Same as above, except that
		  <command>nbd-server</command> will replace the dots
		  in the IP address by forward slashes ('/'); in the
		  same example, <command>nbd-server</command> would
		  open <filename>/export/192/168/1/100</filename>
		  instead.
		</para>
		<para>
		  Since there are no dots in most IPv6 addresses, the
		  effect of using this option when IPv6 is in use is
		  indistinguishable from the ipliteral option. It was
		  thought that having to create an eight-deep directory
		  structure would not be as useful.

	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  This option requires one to add a space and a number
		  after it. <command>nbd-server</command> will use the
		  number as a network mask in CIDR style, and use that
		  as a hash cutoff point. In the above example, if
		  <option>virtstyle</option> has been specified as
		  <constant>cidrhash 16</constant>, then
		  <command>nbd-server</command> will try to open
		  <filename>/export/192.168.0.0/192.168.1.100</filename>;
		  if <option>virtstyle</option> were specified as
		  <constant>cidrhash 26</constant>, then
		  <command>nbd-server</command> will try to open
		  <filename>/export/192.168.1.64/192.168.1.100</filename>.
		</para>
		<para>For IPv6, in the above example, with
