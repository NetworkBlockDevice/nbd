    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is the server for the Linux
    Network Block Device (NBD). With NBD, a client can use a file,
    exported over the network from a server, as a block device. It can
    then be used for whatever purpose a normal block device (harddisk,
    CD-ROM, ...) can be used for.</para>

    <para>NBD can be useful for diskless clients that need swapspace,
    but you can also create a filesystem on it and use it as though it
    were a local filesystem.</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> implements some security
    through a file called "$sysconfdir/nbd-server/allow" (by default; a
    different file can be chosen with the '-l' option or through a
    config file specification). This file must list the IP-addresses or
    network masks of clients that are allowed to connect. If it does not
    exist, all clients are able to connect. If the file is empty, no
    clients can connect.</para>

    <para>Note that while the command line allows for specifying an
    export, the use of this option is deprecated. It is preferred to
    make use of a configuration file instead, the format of which is
    defined in nbd-server(5).</para>

   <para>While nbd-server is running, new exports can be added by
   re-writing configuration files and then sending SIGHUP to
   nbd-server. SIGHUP causes nbd-server to re-read its configuration
   files and to start serving all new exports which were not served
   earlier. Reconfiguration does not modify any existing export, it only
   appends new ones.</para>

    <title>OPTIONS</title>
    
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>ip</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The ip address the server should listen on. This may
	  be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a hostname. In the
	  latter case, nbd-server will do a hostname lookup for the
	  name specified, and will listen on the first address that is
	  returned. For compatibility with past versions of
	  nbd-server, if an IPv4 address is specified, the @ sign that
	  serves as separator between the address and port may be
	  replaced by a colon.</para>
	  <para>If this parameter is not specified, nbd-server will
	  listen on all local addresses on both IPv4 and IPv6. To
	  limit to IPv4, specify the address as 0.0.0.0; to limit to
	  IPv6, specify it as ::.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>port</option>
	</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The port the server should listen to. A valid port is
	    any number between 1 and 65536; if 0 is used, nbd-server
	    will listen on stdin (so that nbd-server can be ran from
	    inetd)</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>filename</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The filename of the file that should be exported. This
	  can be any file, including "real" blockdevices (i.e. a file
	  from /dev). If the filename includes the literal string
	  "%s", then this %s will be substituded with the IP-address
	  of the client trying to connect.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>size</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The size of the block device at the client side. This
	    is especially useful in conjunction with the -m
	    option</para>
	  <para>Can optionally be followed by one of K,k,M or
	    m, in which case the size will be multiplied by 1024 (K
	    or k) or 1048576 (M or m)</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-r</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Export the file read-only. If a client tries to write
	    to a read-only exported file, it will receive an error, but
	    the connection will stay up.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-m</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Work with multiple files. This can be used to export
	    blockdevices that are larger than the maximum allowed
	    filesize on a given filesystem; i.e. when the filesystem
	    does not allow files larger than 2GB (which is true for
	    Linux 2.2 and below), you can use this option to store the
	    data in multiple files and export a larger filesystem, if
	    needed.</para>
	  <para>
	    To use this option, you must create a number of files
	    with names in the format "name.X", where "name" is given as
	    the filename argument to nbd-server, and "X" is a number
	    starting by 0 and going up for each file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Allowing more flexibility for this option is planned for
	    future versions.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-c</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Copy on write. When this option is provided,
	    write-operations are not done to the exported file, but to a
	    separate file. This separate file is removed when the
	    connection is closed, which means that serving this way will
	    make nbd-server slow down (especially on large block devices
	    with lots of writes), and that after disconnecting and
	    reconnecting the client or the server, all changes are
	    lost.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-C</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Specify configuration file. The default configuration
	    file, if this parameter is not specified, is
	    <filename>$sysconfdir/nbd-server/config</filename>.</para>
	  <para>Note that the configuration file is always parsed and
	    the entries in the file used, even if an extra server is
	    specified on the command line. To disable the configuration
	    file entirely, either move it away or use the -C option to
	    point <command>nbd-server</command>(1) to a non-existing or
	    empty configuration file.</para>
	  <para>Also note that if an empty, incomplete, or invalid
	    configuration file is specified, nbd-server will produce a
	    warning about failure to parse the config file. If the
	    command line contains a fully specified configuration, this
	    warning is harmless and may be ignored.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>-M</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Specify the maximum number of opened connections. If this
	  parameter is not specified, no limit is set.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>-d</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Do not fork. Useful for debugging.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>host list filename</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>This argument should contain a list of IP-addresses
	    for hosts that may connect to the server. Wildcards are
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> allowed. If the file does not
	    exist, it is ignored (and any host can connect); If the file
	    does exist, but is empty, no host can connect. By default,
	    the name 'nbd_server.allow' is used, and looked for in the
	    current directory, unless nbd-server is compiled as a
	    daemon, in which case it is looked for in the
	    root-directory.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>section name</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the <option>-o</option> argument is given on the
	  command line, then &dhpackage; will output a configuration
	  file section with this as the header that is functionally
	  equivalent to the other options specified on the command line,
	  and exit. This is useful for migrating pre-2.9 nbd-server
	  initscript configuration files to the new format.</para>
